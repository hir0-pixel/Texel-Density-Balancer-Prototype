# Texel-Density-Balancer-Prototype
This is a protoype version of a texel density balancer that changes the texel density in real time based on vram usage. I have divided the learning into days. Starting from the basics. 
Prerequisites of each day would be the things or files required to be downloaded which are mentioned here. Incase not mentioned. It implies that already installed files are sufficient.

For day 1:
    Install:
    CMake (>=3.20)
    Visual Studio (Desktop C++ workload)
    vcpkg (optional) or just vendor libs
    GLFW (window/input), GLAD (OpenGL loader)
